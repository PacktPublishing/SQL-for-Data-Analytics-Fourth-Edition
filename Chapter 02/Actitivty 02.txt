-- To ensure that this study will not impact the everyday 
-- activities in the production system, they would like to 
-- use a new table customers_copy which is a complete copy 
-- of the existing customers table, instead of directly 
-- running queries against the production customers table. 
CREATE TABLE customers_copy AS (
  SELECT * FROM customers
);


-- They also want to create a new table called 
-- customer_segment, which contains the following 3 fields:
-- customer_segment_id: An integer number that comes from 
-- the source system.
-- customer_segment_desc: A text field that contains up to 
-- 100 characters of the segment name, such as “50 year 
-- old male with wife, kids, and pets”.
-- segment_creation_date: A date field indicating when the 
-- segment was created.
-- Please create this table 
CREATE TABLE customer_segment (
  customer_segment_id INTEGER,
  customer_segment_desc VARCHAR(100),
  segment_creation_date DATE
);

-- For now, the business user has only one sample segment 
-- with ID 1. The segment name is “50 year old male with 
-- wife, kids, and pets” and the creation date was 
-- 01/01/2025. Please insert the sample record into the 
-- table.
INSERT INTO customer_segment 
(customer_segment_id, customer_segment_desc, segment_creation_date) 
VALUES
(1, '50 year old male with wife, kids, and pets', '01/01/2025');

-- Review the value in the customer_segment table
SELECT * FROM customer_segment;

-- After you finish all these tasks, please drop both 
-- tables to save database storage.
DROP TABLE customers_copy;
DROP TABLE customer_segment;
