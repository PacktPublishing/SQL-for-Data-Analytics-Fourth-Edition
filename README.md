SQL remains one of the most powerful tools in modern data analytics, helping you turn data into decisions. This book shows you how to go beyond writing queries to deliver insights that matter.
SQL for Data Analytics, Fourth Edition, is for anyone who wants to move past basic SQL syntax and use it to interpret real-world data with confidence. Whether you're trying to make sense of production data for the first time or upgrading your analytics toolkit, this book gives you the skills to turn data into actionable outcomes.
You'll start by creating and managing structured databases before advancing to data retrieval, transformation, and summarization. From there, you’ll take on more complex tasks such as window functions, statistical operations, and analyzing geospatial, time-series, and text data.
With hands-on exercises, case studies, and detailed guidance throughout, this book prepares you to apply SQL in everyday business contexts—whether you're cleaning data, building dashboards, or presenting findings to stakeholders. By the end, you'll have a powerful SQL toolkit that translates directly to the work analysts do every day.</details>
